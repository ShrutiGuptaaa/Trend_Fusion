Advanced Trend Identification System for Myntra

Overview
The Advanced Trend Identification System for Myntra is designed to leverage data analytics and market research to predict and adopt upcoming fashion trends effectively. This repository contains the implementation of various data processing techniques, statistical analysis, machine learning models, and a user interface (UI) integration using Streamlit.

Key Features
Data Collection: Gather data from fashion blogs, influencer mentions, news articles, and internal sales records.
Data Preprocessing: Handle data cleaning, normalization, and feature extraction.
Statistical Analysis and Visualization: Analyze trends based on seasonal patterns, subtype popularity, and visualize data insights.
Machine Learning Models:
Clustering: Identify trend clusters using K-means clustering.
Time Series Analysis: Use ARIMA and optionally SARIMA models for trend forecasting.
GAN Architecture: Generate trend images using Generative Adversarial Networks.
UI Integration: Develop a user-friendly interface with Streamlit for personalized trend recommendations based on user preferences.
